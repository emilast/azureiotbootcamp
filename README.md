This Bootcamp will help you discover how Azure IoT and related services such as Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Functions and Microsoft Power BI. This immersive workshop will guide you to better understand how to build real-world IoT solutions.

## How it works
You’ll be given an introduction to Azure IoT and related services you will be working with throughout the workshop. Since some of the labs are using Node.js you’ll be given a short overview of Node.js and JavaScript. From this point forward you are on your own building the labs. But don’t worry, we are here to help you along if you need assistance.

**Also, you are free to team up with other attendees. – It’s not a competition, we are all there to learn.**

## Prerequisites

In the invitation to the IoT Bootcamp you were instructed to come prepared with a laptop and:

* Visual Studio Code
* Node.js
* Putty
* Azure account
* Power BI account

If you didn't have time to prepare, no worries, just follow the instructions from [here](https://github.com/wmmihaa/azureiotbootcamp/blob/master/misc/Prerequisites.md)

## Your Devices
Throughout this Bootcamp you’re going to be using a Raspberry PI 3 model B together with a TI sensor tag from Texas Instrument. 

The Raspberry PI has been preinstalled with Raspian OS and Node.Js. It has also been provided a unique name and connected to the WiFi. Connection information should be found in the box. The Raspberry PI is going to play the role of your device.

The TI Sensor tag is a Bluetooth connected sensor. – In fact, it’s 10 sensors:
* Temperature
* Accelerometer
* Gyroscope
* Magnetometer
* Humidity (relative humidity and temperature)
* Barometer (pressure and temperature)
* Optical light intensity (LUX)

Your TI Sensor has been paired with your Raspberry PI.

## Set up your IoT Hub and register your device
Before you get started with any of the labs, go through [these](https://github.com/wmmihaa/azureiotbootcamp/blob/master/misc/CreateIoTHub.md) instructions to set up your Azure IoT hub. 

### [Setup IoT Hub](https://github.com/wmmihaa/azureiotbootcamp/blob/master/misc/CreateIoTHub.md)

## LABS
